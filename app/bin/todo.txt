Setting up Python Environment:
Installed Python versions on workstation:
C:\Python27\
C:\Users\<UserID>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\
The PyScripter-x64 PyScripter shortcut can be adjusted to one of the following targets values:
 - "C:\Program Files\PyScripter\PyScripter.exe" --PYTHON37
 - "C:\Program Files\PyScripter\PyScripter.exe" --PYTHON27
Prior to running PyScripter, adjust the following file with one of above Target settings
with a right-click to Properties on the following file: (Must have Admin privs)
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\PyScripter-64\PyScripter
   NOTES: 
     1. You can only run one of the Python versions via PyScripter at a time on Windows 10.
     2. Not an issue for command line on linux or macs. (Windows OS only for PyScripter)
     3. Need the flexibility to code in 2 and 3 versions of Python as support for 2 ends in 2020.

Working with PyScripter IDE to aid in learning python. 
    NOTE: - Backwards compatibility becomes less of an issue as MDP becomes more focused on CI/CD
            automation. Examples include centOS 6 to 7 and python 2 to 3.
