  <h2>&lt;section&gt;</h2>
<p>Once I figured out the "fixed" format of html5 websites this template got pretty easy. This paragraph is purposely being made long to see how the following &lt;article&gt; section deals with it. It is strait text with no updates to the style.css file. So far the &lt;article&gt; section just keeps moving down the page. Let's try a new paragraph.</p>
<article>
  <h2>&lt;article&gt;</h2>
  <p title="I'm a tooltip">
     Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.
  </p>
</article>
<p>Here is a new paragraph. Need to adjust the left margin of the paragraph text so there is some space between the text and the edge of this &lt;section&gt; block.</p>

<p>Also note that moving the &lt;article&gt; section in-between the previous paragraph and this one produced the desired affect of placing this text to the left of the &lt;article&gt; section.</p>

<p>After adjusting the padding values from "0px 0px 0px 0px" to "Opx 10px 0px 10px", the width percent needed to be adjusted from 78% to 76% bring the &lt;section&gt; back up along side next to the &lt;aside&gt; section.</p>

<p>Note that these padding values reference Top -> right -> bottom -> Left of the text.</p>

<p>In addition, the &lt;section&gt; height value needed to be adjusted from 550px to 554px. Since this paragraph is now positioned fully above the second &lt;article&gt; section, the next paragraph will be placed after the second &lt;article&gt; section. This should put next to the following &lt;article&gt; section.</p>

<article>
  <h2>&lt;article&gt;</h2>
</article>

<p>The position of this paragraph is to the left of the section &lt;article&gt; section as expected. Also note that it needs to be "before" the ending &lt;/section&gt; tag.</p>

<p>After a few more adjustments for the &lt;article&gt; section, I will mention them and add a few more paragraphs to test the "overflow-y:scroll;" setting for this &lt;section&gt; block.</p>

<p>In addition to adding the "border-radius: 15px;" setting for rounded corners on the &lt;article&gt; section definition in the style.css file, the following was also done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; -> margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px;</li>
  <li>padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px; -> margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px;</li>
</ul>

<p>Take note that the &lt;article&gt; section block defined once in the style.css file and used twice in this &lt;section&gt; block.</p>

<p>Note that most adjustments made to this "basis" html5 website template during experimentation are mentioned in this &lt;section&gt; block. In addition, the "#" was used to comment out any configuration changes that where made to the style.css file while experimenting.</p>

<p>After &lt;nav&gt; section button formats are designed and added to this "basis" website template, It can be used as a general "basis" starting point for future website development.</p>

<p>Note that we have added enough text to test the the "overflow-y:scroll;" configuration setting for this &lt;section&gt; block. It is working as expected :).</p>
