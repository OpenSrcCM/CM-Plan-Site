Purpose of /app/site directory

Contains the elements that the CM Plan Site is built from.  The script
package-deploy.bsh assembles a tar gz file for deployment to an apache
website html directory. 

All deployment testing and automation occurs via the deploy directory.
Refer to the README.txt in the deploy directory for details.

Sub-Directories: (listed in order of development usage)

learn

   This directory is not linked to the website. It is available from the
   browser address bar only. It is intended for developer notes.

   Contents of this direct are used to experiment with a "best in class"
   approach to using html5 concepts.

workarea

   This directory is used to build the Site content. The primary tool is
   AsciidocFX. The asciidoc syntax is used to create html5 formatted content
   for the CM Plan Site. The resulting asciidoc and html5 files are maintained
   here.
   
   The html5 files (*.html) are then copied into their respective website
   directories where they are modified into index.html files for each site
   directory.

basis

   This directory contains the primary CM Plan Site components destined for
   the apache /var/www/html directory. The home page of the website is
   stored in this directory for packaging. It is updated and maintained in the
   workarea directory.
   
   The workarea directory is used to create elements for the other directories
   that become sub-directories of the website. These are gathered and tar`d in
   the $TargetTarDir directory. This variable is in the package-deploy.bsh
   script.
