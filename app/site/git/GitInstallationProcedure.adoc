=== Initial git Configurations

After you have installed Git successfully, you have full Git functionality on your workstation.

[green]#Be sure to use the Git Bash session you just installed for the following sections.#

Try the following commands in your Git Bash window:

Run '**git help git**' to display the help index in a browser window.
Run '**git help <command>**' to display help for specific commands in a browser window.

.In order to interface with the https://github.com/[GitHub] system, the following needs to be performed:
* Identify or Set $HOME variable on your Workstation.
* Build and Configure SSH key Usage
* Identify yourself in Git:
** Name
** email
** Setup your default editor
** Setup the diff tool you will use
* Add SSH Aliases
* Verify Git remote "origin"

[NOTE]
====
The above bullets are covered in http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup[First-Time Git setup]. You may also find the GitHub Help page https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/[Set Up Git] useful.
====

The following sections cover required and recommended configurations.

=== Identify Yourself in Git

.Enter your first and last name:
* $ git config --global user.name "Andy Wallace"

.Enter your Comcast email address:
* $ git config --global user.email Andrew_Wallace@cable.comcast.com

.Setup your editor:
* $ git config --global core.editor vim

.Setup you diff tool:
* $ git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

.You can run the following command to see all of your Git settings:
* $ git config --list

[TIP]
====
.Verify the following values have been configured:
. user.name
. user.email
. core.editor
. merge.tool
====

For windows, verify your git workarea(s) on your windows workstation are on the C Drive in your home directory.

=== Identify the $HOME variable on Your Workstation

.Mac instructions:
. $HOME should be defined already

.Windows 10 specific instructions:
. Right Click Windows pane (lower right) and select "System"
. Search for "View Advanced System Settings"
. Click on the *Environment Variables...* button on the System Properties window
. Verify there is a *HOME* variable in the *System variables* list. This variable is referenced by SSH when supporting remote functionality.
.. Should be set to C:\Users\[userid].
.. Create (New button) or adjust (edit button) the *HOME* system variable accordingly.

=== Build and Configure SSH key Usage

You can reference http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key[Generating Your SSH Public Key] for more details on the following instructions.

.Execute the following in your new Git Bash window.
* $ ls -la ~/

.If your do not have a ~/.ssh directory, create it:
* $ mkdir c:\Users\[userid]\.ssh

[WARNING]
====
*Use the Git Bash window. Windows Explorer will not allow you to create the .ssh directory.*)
====

$ cd ~/.ssh  (c:\Users\[userid]\.ssh)

* Set the ~/.ssh permissions to 740 *($ chmod -R 740 ~/.ssh)*
* Set the file permissions in ~/.ssh to 740 *(Just verify, should be done from previous step.)*

[NOTE]
====
Note the "~/" utilizes the workstation system *HOME* variable for your userid.
====

.Generate ssh key pair using your NTLogon:
* $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f [Your userid] (userid is all lower-case, no mixed case.)

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended you enter nothing for the pass phrase.
====

.The following two files will be generated:
* *[Your NTLogon]* -  Your *[red]#private#* key file
* *[Your NTLogon].pub* -  Your *[green]#public#* key file

[CAUTION]
====
*Never send your private key in an email or attach it to any ticket.*
====

Your interaction with the GitHub managed repositories will be more secure using your ssh key.
====

.Setup your ssh Key on GitHub
. Copy your public key into your paste buffer
. Logon to https://github.com/[GitHub]
. On upper-right of window select pulldown for _**Your Profile**_
. Select _**Edit profile**_ button
. Select _**SSH keys and GPG keys**_
. Click on the _**New SSH key**_ button and follow instructions.

=== Add SSH Aliases

To reduce typing and minimize ssh key issues, the following is done to provide ssh aliases for the EMM Git System servers. Add a config file under the \~/.ssh on your workstation for your NTLogon as follows.

Edit (or create) ~/.ssh/config and add the following lines adjusted for your [blue]#userid#:

$ vim ~/.ssh/config

[TIP]
====
Be sure to read all comments whenever you enter git commands. They usually contain some indication of what you need to enter next.
====


== GitHub

Once you have established an account with GitHub, mimic the following on your workstation in your new Git Bash Session:

image::images/initial-clone-repo.png[]

Now you have established a git repo local on your workstation from the Github system. You can verify the git remote origin in the local copy on your workstation.

The git remote `origin` should be setup for communication between your workstation repo and the GitHub system. Reference http://gitref.org/remotes/#remote[git remote] for more details.

image::images/show-origin-remote.png[]

If you are unable to mimic the above Git bash sessions on your workstation, review the *_Add SSH Aliases_* section of this document.

== Git Introduction

If you are new to Git, refer to the following links:
* https://git-scm.com/doc
* https://www.youtube.com/user/github/videos

==  GitHub

There are two protected main branches in the cmguy/CM-Plan-Site repo, _**develop**_, and _**master**_. Reference http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[a successful-git-branching-model] for details.

.To update the _**develop**_ or _**master**_ branch, GitHub pull requests should be done. This initiates a colaborative code review session with the repo owner. To do this:
. git push the branch you wish to merge
. Do a GitHub pull request. Reference *"Show me how"* at https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/push-pull-request-github-desktop[Push to Github & Create a Pull Request] for a specific example.
. Click on pull request and add reviewers
. Review and address comments from reviewers
. Merge pull request

== Git Conflict Reporting

Reporting on git merge conflicts before actually doing a merge provides a view into additional deltas that need to be considered before doing a merge.

A script tool, *report-conflicts.bsh* has been prepared for DevOps personnel to identify all conflicts to all main, and outstanding release branches for a given feature branch.
[TIP]
====
Reference the *Branching and Merging Workflow* section of the Git ./user-guide.pdf[User Guide].
====

The *report-conflicts.bsh* is designed to be run from any DevOps contributor's workstation or laptop.

.Installation Instructions
. Create a "bin" directory under your ~/ directory
. Add C:\Users\userid\bin to your workstation or laptop User Variable Path.
. Get local to your new bin directory and install the report-conflicts.bsh script to it.
* cd ~/bin
* cp ~/repo-workareas/CM-Plan-Site/app/bin/report-conflicts.bsh .
. Setup directories to be used only by the report-conflicts.bsh.
* mkdir ~/repo-workareas/conflict-reports
* mkdir ~/repo-workareas/conflict-reports/log
. Open the script report-conflicts.bsh with vim and set the RepoHome variable to "/c/Users/userid/repo-workareas/conflict-reports".
. Execute the following for execution instructions:
* report-conflicts.bsh -h

[NOTE]
====
. Reference the *"Identify the $HOME variable on Your Workstation"* to get you to the "Environments Variables" window to update your User Variable *Path*.
