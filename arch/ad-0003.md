# Context

Reference AD-0002. Note it's current status is **"Preposes"**. This ADR and it's related updates are currently in the **Prepare Phase**.

Reference AD-0001 while updating or changing this ADR for structure.

Adding containerization to the development environment is the primary **goal** of this ADR.

1. The approach to be followed is to build a container environment on the current centOS7 based VM.
    * Docker has been chosen as the best example of containerization based on linux lxc and cgroups.
    * The [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) site is the reference being used.
       * As of 11/10/2018, [Part 1: Orientation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) has been addressed.

## Decision

Add Containerization on top of the current Virtual Machine (VM) based on centOS7. 
The primary references for this task will be listed in the reference section of this ADR.

The change approach followed is outlined in AD-0002.md.
